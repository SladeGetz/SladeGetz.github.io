I am a graduating senior at the Colorado School of Mines, studing computer science and cyber security.
<br>
I have a passion for information security and love investigating related matters. I attend security conferences when I can and am always looking to learn more.
<br>
My most rewarding experiences have been when I was a teaching assistant for the Information Security and Privacy class (CSCI475). I still have former students reaching out to me for help in their classes!
